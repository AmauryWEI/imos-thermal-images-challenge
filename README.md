# imos-thermal-images-challenge

This repository contains documentation and source code to tackle two deep-learning
challenges.

## Challenges Descriptions

### Challenge 1

Using this
[Long-term Thermal Drift Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivannikolov/longterm-thermal-drift-dataset)
to implement a deep-learning based method to predict the temperature in Celsius using
the thermal images (and metadata if needed). Use the code provided in the repo for data
loading, and feel free to use pytorch or tensorflow as you see fit.

### Challenge 2

Implement a pedestrian detection method based of the labelled data. Since YOLOv5 and
Faster R-CNN are included in the repo, try to use a different method.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

1. Clone this repository
2. Download the
[Long-term Thermal Drift Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivannikolov/longterm-thermal-drift-dataset)
3. Create a Python virtual environment and install the necessary packages

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.10.12 imos
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
